# The intent of this playbook is to be run from Vagrant or from a CI like Travis
# or Gitlab, but mostly vagrant. The purpose of the structure of this playbooks is
# so that vagrant can loop through all of the supported boxes in the Vagrantfile
# and pass/fail them based on whether or not the VM still exists and is paused.
# Whereas, since there is a viable status check - successful plays need not keep
# a VM behind. The suspended VMs can thus be started and inspected for problems.
# They are paused to conserve resources on computers that can only handle a few
# VMs at a time. Here we are utilizing the ability of ansible to run both local
# tasks (to manage vagrant) on the provisining system, and capture errors in the
# "rescue:" block. (to keep vagrant from exiting on an ansible error.)
